# Project-Euler

A huge disclaimer to any viewer - my experience with coding these solutions was really engaging, enjoyable and important. Therefore, depriving oneself of this experience and directly viewing the solutions would surely be unfruitful. One should rather solve any question individually, compare solutions afterwards, and perhaps discuss more efficeint solutions. Happy coding for now!
